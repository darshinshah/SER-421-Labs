I developed the assignment incrementally & both the task are in the same server.
task3server.js & task2server.js are essentially the same files - Ive made copies for your convenience.

To run it do the following:
1) node task2server.js
2) and go to : http://localhost:3000/index.html for evaluation of the assignment.

Thanks!
